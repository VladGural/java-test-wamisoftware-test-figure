# Java Test Assignment (Middle Java Developer position at Wamisoftware)

## **Task**
Develop an application for calculating the area and perimeter of geometric shapes.
The application should be implemented as a REST API. The minimum set of shapes
to support includes a square, a rectangle, a triangle, and a circle (perimeter is the
circumference length).

## **Requirements**
1. Create a Spring Boot 2 application using Java 8+.
2. Implement a single REST API endpoint that accepts input for calculating the area
   and perimeter of different geometric shapes. The endpoint should not use
   conditional statements (e.g., if-else) to determine the shape calculation service
   based on the request.
3. Support the following geometric shapes:
- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Circle (perimeter is the circumference length)
4. Implement validation.
5. Use appropriate HTTP status codes.

## **Technology Stack**
- Spring Boot 2
- Java 8+
- Any additional libraries or frameworks within the Spring ecosystem as needed.

## **Submission**
Please submit your solution as a Git repository with a README file that includes
instructions on how to build and run the application, as well as any other relevant
information about your implementation.

## Good luck with the assignment!

 
# How run solution of this test

You should have JDK 17+, Maven, Docker, and Git installed on your computer to run this test. 

Create a new directory and move to it
```
mkdir java_test && cd java_test
```

Clone all artifacts from GitHab repository
```
git clone https://github.com/VladGural/java-test-wamisoftware-test-figure
```

Build and put figure service in the local maven repo. 
Meanwhile, it will start component tests for Figure service.
```
mvn -f ./java-test-wamisoftware-test-figure/pom.xml clean install
```

Create docker image for Figure service
```
docker build -t figure-service ./java-test-wamisoftware-test-figure/.
```

And now run service in docker containers
```
docker compose -f ./java-test-wamisoftware-test-figure/compose.yaml up --detach
```

For check type, the next
```
docker ps
```

And if everything was done correctly we will see something like this.
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                     NAMES
e27c83222927   figure-service   "/__cacert_entrypoinâ€¦"   15 seconds ago   Up 14 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, [::]:8080->80/tcp   figure-service
```

Our service are running!!!

For testing we can use postmen
